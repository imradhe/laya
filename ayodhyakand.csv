She cast off her highly precious pearl necklace worth many hundreds of thousands (of rupees) and other costly, beautiful ornaments. Thereafter that goldenhued Kaikeyi lay down on the floor and said to Manthara: "
इह वा मां मृतां कुब्जे नृपायावेदयिष्यसि।वनं तु राघवे प्राप्ते भरतः प्राप्स्यति क्षितिम्।।2.9.58।।,"O hunchback, tell the king, either Bharata shall secure the kingdom on Rama's departure to the forest or else I will die here. "

Laying her hands on the chest again and again and expressing her amazement, she praised that hunchback."
यमस्य वा मां विषयं गतामितोनिशाम्य कुब्जे प्रतिवेदयिष्यसि।वनं गते वा सुचिराय राघवेसमृद्धकामो भरतो भविष्यति।।2.9.63।।,Tell the king that he will see either the fulfilment of Bharata's desire after Rama is banished into the forest for a long period or me gone to Yama's abode.

But the magnanimous king was greatly afflicted to see the calamity on his son.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अयोध्याकाण्डे अष्टादशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the eighteenth sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the oly Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki. "
[Rama hears from Kaikeyi about the boons promised by Dasarathaconsents to leave for the forest goes to meet Kausalya.] तदप्रियममित्रघ्नो वचनं मरणोपमम्।श्रुत्वा न विव्यथे रामः कैकेयीं चेदमब्रवीत्।।2.19.1।।,The destroyer of enemies (Rama) did not feel distressed to hear these words painful like death.

He did not disclose the obstruction that had come on the way of achieving his objective for fear of causing distress to his friends. इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अयोध्याकाण्डे एकोनविंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the nineteenth sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki. "
[Rama enters to the inner apartment of his mother Kausalya--informs her of his exile to the forest--lamentations of Kausalya.] तस्मिंस्तु पुरुषव्याघ्रे निष्क्रामति कृताञ्जलौ।आर्तशब्दो महान् जज्ञे स्त्रीणामन्तःपुरे तदा।।2.20.1।।," When the tiger among men (Rama) was coming out with folded palms, there arose a huge cry of distress among the ladies of the harem:"

All these three are doubtless there (in my decision to go to the forest), like obedience in a wife and love for the mother in good sons. "
यस्मिंस्तु सर्वे स्युरसन्निविष्टा धर्मो यत स्स्यात्तदुपक्रमेत।द्वेष्यो भवत्यर्थपरो हि लोके कामात्मता खल्वपि न प्रशस्ता।।2.21.57।।," If actions which combine these three (dharma, artha and kama), cannot be performed (which is likely), resort to righteousness. (For) one who seeks wealth is abhorred and one who seeks fulfilment of desires does not attract admiration in this world. "

Who will not do it unless he is heartless?"
स वै न शक्नोमि पितुः प्रतिज्ञामिमामकर्तुं सकलां यथावत्।स ह्यावयोस्तात गुरुर्नियोगेदेव्याश्च भर्ता स गति स्सधर्मः।।2.21.59।।,"It is impossible for me not to execute the promise completely, O my dear, he (Dasaratha) is our preceptor and, therefore, fit to command us. Even for  mother Kausalya, he is her husband, her refuge and her dharma."
तस्मिन्पुनर्जीवति धर्मराजे विशेषतस्स्वे पथि वर्तमाने।देवी मया सार्धमितोऽपगच्छेत्कथं स्विदन्या विधवेव नारी।।2.21.60।।," While the righteous king is living, more importantly treading the righteous path, how can mother Kausalya, like an ordinary widow, accompany me leaving this city? "
सा माऽनुमन्यस्व वनं व्रजन्तंकुरुष्व न स्स्वस्त्ययनानि देवि।यथा समाप्ते पुनराव्रजेयं यथा हि सत्येन पुनर्ययातिः।।2.21.61।।,"Grant me permission O mother, to depart for the forest. Bless me and perform ceremonies for my wellbeing so that I shall return (to the city) after completion (of my exile) like Yayati (who came back to heaven) with the strength of truth. "

In this transient existence O mother, I do not wish to acquire this insignificant earth unrighteously."

Dismiss this humiliation (from the mind). Achieve great happiness through fortitude. Remove whatever preparations have been made for the purpose of (my) consecration today, and act quickly so that there is no obstacle. "
सौमित्रे योऽभिषेकार्थे मम सम्भार सम्भ्रमः।अभिषेकनिवृत्त्यर्थे सोऽस्तु संभारसम्भ्रमः।।2.22.5।।,O Lakshmana the same enthusiasm with which preparations for my consecration were made be shown for the cessation of those arrangements.  
यस्या मदभिषेकार्थे मानसं परितप्यते।माता मे सा यथा न स्यात्सविशङ्का तथा कुरु।।2.22.6।।,"Act in such a way that our mother (Kaikeyi), whose heart ached due to my consecration should not entertain any doubt.    "

तस्याऽपि हि भवेदस्मिन्कर्मण्यप्रतिसंहृते।सत्यं नेति मनस्तापस्तस्य तापस्तपेच्च माम्।।2.22.10।।,"If the preparations for the consecration are not withdrawn, my father will suffer mental agony for the fear that his word has not come true and his agony will torment me."
अभिषेकविधानं तु तस्मात्संहृत्य लक्ष्मण।अन्वगेवाहमिच्छामि वनं गन्तुमितःपुनः।।2.22.11।।,"Therefore, O Lakshmana I want the arrangement for coronation withdrawn before I proceed to the forest from here itself."

This great haste is unwarranted for there is the least apprehension about people's verdict (in favour of exile). How do you, of all persons, speak about destiny as allpowerful in these circumstances when it is powerless?"
किन्नाम कृपणं दैवमशक्तमभिशंससि।।2.23.7।।पापयोस्ते कथं नाम तयोश्शङ्का न विद्यते।,Why do you extol this pitiable and powerless destiny? Why don't you doubt those two vicious persons (Dasaratha and Kaikeyi)?
सन्ति धर्मोपधा श्लक्ष्णाः धर्मात्मन्किं न बुध्यसे।।2.23.8।।तयोस्सुचरितं स्वार्थं शाठ्यात्परिजिहीर्षतोः।,"Why don't you realise, O virtuous one that there are soft means of creating hindrances in their plan without trangressing dharma. You know dharma. Why don't you understand that their acts of deception wear the guise of dharma?"
यदि नैवं व्यवसितं स्याद्धि प्रागेव राघव।।2.23.9।।तयोः प्रागेव दत्तश्च स्याद्वरः प्रकृतश्च सः।,"If both of them had not decided before, O Rama the boon granted to Kaikeyi naturally would have been fulfilled long ago. "
लोकविद्विष्टमारब्धं त्वदन्यस्याभिषेचनम्।नोत्सहे सहितुं वीर तत्र मे क्षन्तुमर्हसि।।2.23.10।।," The consecration of any one other than you, O valiant one is universally detested. I do not want to tolerate (this act). You should pardon me in this matter."
येनेय मागता द्वैधं तव बुद्धिर्महामते।स हि धर्मो मम द्वेष्यः प्रसङ्गाद्यस्य मुह्यसि।।2.23.11।।,O noble minded one I hate this righteousness which has deluded your intellect and created this dilemma about this issue.
कथं त्वं कर्मणा शक्तः कैकेयीवशवर्तिनः।करिष्यसि पितुर्वाक्यमधर्मिष्ठं विगर्हितम्।।2.23.12।।," When you are able to counter (this move), why do you want to execute the unjustifiable and contemptible words of the king who is under the spell of Kaikeyi? "
यद्ययं किल्बिषाद्भेदः कृतोऽप्येवं न गृह्यते।जायते तत्र मे दुःखं धर्मसङ्गश्च गर्हितः।।2.23.13।।," I am grieved that even though this plot has been hatched by a treacherous mind, you are not taking it in the right perspective. Censurable is adherence to virtue. "
मनसाऽपि कथं कामं कुर्यास्त्वं कामवृत्तयोः।तयोस्त्वहितयोर्नित्यं शत्र्वोः पित्रभिधानयोः।।2.23.14।।,"As both of them are steeped in passion, they never thought of your wellbeing. How will you fulfil the wishes of these enemies miscalled parents?"
यद्यपि प्रतिपत्तिस्ते दैवी चापि तयोर्मतम्।तथाप्युपेक्षणीयं ते न मे तदपि रोचते।।2.23.15।।," It might be your opinion that their dictate is the decree of destiny. Even then, it does not satisfy me. It (destiny) should be ignored."

मद्बलेन विरुद्धाय न स्याद्दैवबलं तथा।प्रभविष्यति दुःखाय यथोग्रं पौरुषं मम।।2.23.24।।, Any one who opposes my terrible valour will come to grief. The power of destiny will not cause that much sorrow as my valour will. 
ऊर्ध्वं वर्षसहस्रान्ते प्रजापाल्यमनन्तरम्।आर्यपुत्राः करिष्यन्ति वनवासं गते त्वयि।।2.23.25।।,When after ruling the subjects for a thousand years you withdraw into the forest (for yativrata) your sons will rule them.

Or else, I shall never attain the afterworld of heroes."
मङ्गलैरभिषिञ्चस्व तत्र त्वं व्यापृतो भव।अहमेको महीपालानलं वारयितुं बलात्।।2.23.29।।,The consecration may be performed with these auspicious materials. I am alone capable of facing these kings with my valour.

This bow is not for decoration. The sword is not for the sake of strapping my waist. The arrows are not meant to be fixed to my quiver. All these four are meant for taming my enemies.

This is the true path (for me). इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अयोध्याकाण्डे त्रयोविंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the twentythird sarga of Ayodhyakanda of  the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.

रामे हि यौवराज्यस्थे राजा दशरथो वनम्। प्रवेक्ष्यति महेष्वासः पूर्ववृत्तमनुस्मरन्।।2.35.35।।," If Rama is installed as heirapparent, king Dasaratha, the great archer will retire to the forest for carrying out austerities following ancient customs."
इति सान्त्वैश्च तीक्ष्णैश्च कैकेयीं राजसंसदि। सुमन्त्रः क्षोभयामास भूय एव कृताज्जलिः।।2.35.36।।, Sumantra tried with words both gentle and sharp to make Kaikeyi regret. And then stood with folded palms in the presence of the king.    
नैव सा क्षुभ्यते देवी न च स्म परिदूयते। न चास्या मुखवर्णस्य विक्रिया लक्ष्यते तदा।।2.35.37।।," (Despite the exhortations by Sumantra) Kaikeyi remained unperturbed. She did not feel sorry. There was no change in the expression of her face.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अयोध्याकाण्डे पंचत्रिंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the thirtyfifth sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.   "
[King Dasaratha orders four divisions of the army and a lot of wealth to be sent with Rama --Kaikeyi objects --Siddhartha appeases Kaikeyi--the king expresses his desire to accompany Rama to the forest.]ततस्सुमन्त्रमैक्ष्वाकः पीडितोऽत्र प्रतिज्ञया। सबाष्पमतिनिश्श्वश्य जगादेदं पुनः पुनः।।2.36.1।।,"Afflicted on account of the promise he had made, Dasaratha, descendant of the Ikshvakus heaved deep sighs again and again and with his eyes full of tears uttered these words to Sumantra:"
सूत रत्नसुसम्पूर्णा चतुर्विधबला चमूः। राघवस्यानुयात्रार्थं क्षिप्रं प्रतिविधीयताम्।।2.36.2।।,"O Sumantra arrange immediately four divisions of the army, wellequipped with  precious stones to escort Rama in his journey to (the forest)."
रूपाजीवाश्च वादिन्यो वणिजश्च महाधनाः।शोभयन्तु कुमारस्य वाहिनीं सुप्रसारिताः।।2.36.3।।,"Let the sweettongued courtesans, opulent merchants with well spreadout merchandise make the army of my son graceful. "
ये चैनमुपजीवन्ति रमते यैश्च वीर्यतः। तेषां बहुविधं दत्त्वा तानप्यत्र नियोजय ।।2.38.4।।,Bestow immense wealth on those who depended on Rama for their living and on the gallant youths with whom he used to sport. Send them along with the entourage. 
आयुधानि च मुख्यानि नागरा श्शकटानि च। अनुगच्छन्तु काकुत्स्थं व्याधाश्चारण्य गोचराः।।2.36.5।।," Main weapons, citizens (bodyguards), carts, wanderers in the forest and fowlers wellacquainted with the forest shall follow Rama. "
निघ्नन् मृगान् कुञ्जरांश्च पिबंश्चारण्यकं मधु। नदीश्च विविधाः पश्यन्न राज्यस्य स्मरिष्यति।।2.36.6।।," Hunting the elephants and antelopes, drinking forest honey, beholding several rivers on the way, Rama will not recollect the kingdom. "
धान्यकोशश्च यः कश्चिद्धनकोशश्च मामकः। तौ राममनुगच्छेतां वसन्तं निर्जने वने।।2.36.7।।, Let the entire contents of my granary and treasury follow Rama wherever he lives in the desolate forest. 
यजन् पुण्येषु देशेषु विसृजं श्चाप्तदक्षिणाः। ऋषिभिश्च समागम्य प्रवत्स्यति सुखं वने।।2.36.8।।,"Performing sacrifices in the holy places and liberally giving appropriate gifts, Rama will live happily in the forest in the company of sages. "
भरतश्च महाबाहुरयोध्यां पालयिष्यति। सर्वकामैः सह श्रीमान् रामः संसाध्यतामिति ।।2.36.9।।,"(While) mightyarmed Bharata will rule Ayodhya, Rama be furnished with all objects of enjoyment. "
एवं ब्रुवति काकुत्स्थे कैकेय्या भय मागतम्। मुखं चाप्यगमच्छोषं स्वरश्चापि न्यरुध्यत।।2.36.10।।,"  While Dasaratha was saying these words, Kaikeyi was gripped by fear and her face looked pale. Even her voice got choked. "
सा विषण्णा च सन्त्रस्ता मुखेन परिशुष्यता। राजानमेवाभिमुखी कैकेयी वाक्यमब्रवीत्।।2.36.11।।,"The dejected and frightened Kaikeyi with a dry countenance, looked at the king and said: "
राज्यं गतजनं साधो पीतमण्डां सुरामिव। निरास्वाद्यतमं शून्यं भरतो नाभिपत्स्यते।।2.36.12।।,"O virtuous king Bharata will not take charge of the kingdom abandoned by men, drained of wealth and incapable of being enjoyed, like wine with its essence evaporated."
कैकेय्यां मुक्तलज्जायां वदन्त्यामतिदारुणाम्। राजा दशरथो वाक्यमुवाचायतलोचनाम्।।2.36.13।।,"  King Dasaratha heard the terribly cruel and shameless words of that largeeyed Kaikeyi, and said: "
वहन्तं किं तुदसि मां नियुज्य धुरि माऽहिते। अनार्ये कृत्यमारब्धं किं न पूर्वमुपारुधः।।2.36.14।।,"O brutal Kaikeyi, you fastened me to the yoke and when I am drawing forward, why do you beat me? O vile woman why did  you not prevent me in the beginning itself?"
तस्यैतत्क्रोधसंयुक्तमुक्तं श्रुत्वा वराङ्गना। कैकेयी द्विगुणं क्रुद्धा राजानमिदमब्रवीत्।।2.36.15।।,"At these wrathful words of Dasaratha, Kaikeyi with redoubled fury replied to the king:"
वैव वंशे सगरो ज्येष्ठं पुत्रमुपारुधत्। असमञ्ज इति ख्यातं तथायं गन्तुमर्हति।।2.36.16।।, In your own dynasty  king Sagara prevented his wellknown eldest son Asamanjasa (from enjoying the kingdom). Rama also should depart in the same manner.  
एवमुक्तो धिगित्येव राजा दशरथोऽब्रवीत्। व्रीडितश्च जनस्सर्व स्सा च तं नावबुध्यत।।2.36.17।।," Hearing the words of Kaikeyi, Dasaratha could say only 'shame'. All the people felt ashamed, but Kaikeyi could not understand this."
तत्र वृद्धो महामात्रस्सिद्धार्थो नाम नामतः। शुचिर्बहुमतो राज्ञः कैकेयी मिदमब्रवीत्।।2.38.18।।,"An aged minister named Siddhartha who justified his name, highly respected by the king said this to Kaikeyi:"
असमञ्जो गृहीत्वा तु क्रीडतः पथि बालकान्। सरय्वाः प्रक्षिपन्नप्सु रमते तेन दुर्मतिः।।2.36.19।।,That wickedminded Asamanjasa used to seize the children playing on the street and amuse himself by hurling them in the waters of river Sarayu. 
तं दृष्ट्वा नागरा स्सर्वे कृद्धा राजानमब्रुवन्।असमञ्जं वृणीष्वैकमस्मान्वा राष्ट्रवर्धन।।2.36.20।।," Watching it, all the enraged citizens said to the king, 'O enhancer of the prosperity of the kingdom, either you choose Asamanjasa or us'. "
तानुवाच ततो राजा किन्निमित्तमिदं भयम्।ताश्चापि राज्ञा सम्पृष्टा वाक्यं प्रकृतयोऽब्रुवन्।।2.36.21।।," The king  then asked them, 'Why this fear?'. And the citizens responded:"
डक्रीडतस्त्वेष नः पुत्रान् बालानुद्भ्रान्तचेतनः। सरय्वां प्रक्षिपन्मौर्ख्यादतुलां प्रीतिमश्नुते।।2.36.22।।, That insane (Asamanjasa) while throwing our children who were playing around into Sarayu river in his insanity derived incomparable pleasure'.   
स तासां वचनं श्रुत्वा प्रकृतीनां नराधिपः। तं तत्याजाहितं पुत्रं तेषां प्रियचिकीर्षया।।2.36.23।।,"  That king (Sagara) heard the words of the citizens and with the intention of doing good to them, banished that malevolent son. "
तं यानं शीघ्रमारोप्य सभार्यं सपरिच्छदम्।यावज्जीवं विवास्योऽयमिति स्वानन्वशात्पिता।।2.36.24।।, Then the father made him and his wife climb a carriage with the clothes they had at the time on them and at once ordered his servants to banish him for life. 
स फालपिटकं गृह्य गिरिदुर्गाण्यलोडयत्। दिश स्सर्वास्त्वनुचरन् स यथा पापकर्मकृत्।।2.36.25।।,"Like an evildoer wandering about in different directions, holding a spade and a basket in his hand, he went about digging the impenetrable mountains.   "
इत्येनमत्यजद्राजा सगरो वै सुधार्मिकः। रामः किमकरोत्पापं येनैवमुपरुध्यते।।2.36.26।।, Highly righteous king Sagara thus banished his son. What sin has Rama committed to secure a similar banishment? 
न हि कञ्चन पश्यामो राघवस्यागुणं वयम्।दुर्लभो ह्यस्य निरय श्शशाङ्कस्येव कल्मषम्।।2.36.27।।, We see no fault in Rama. Unlike the stain in the Moon it is difficult to find any  blemish in him.
अथवा देवि दोषं त्वं कञ्चित्पश्यसि राघवे। तमद्य ब्रूहि तत्वेन तदा रामो विवास्यताम्।।2.36.28।।,O Kaikeyi speak truly if you find any fault in this scion of the Raghu race (Rama). Then he will be exiled. 
अदुष्टस्य हि संत्यागः सत्पथे निरतस्य च।  निर्दहेदपि शक्रस्य द्युतिं धर्मनिरोधनात्।2.36.29।।, The act of banishment of an innocent one walking the righteous path is like destroying the brilliance of Indra by restraining his righteousness.
तदलं देवि रामस्य श्रिया विहतया त्वया। लोकतोऽपि हि ते रक्ष्यः परिवादः शुभानने।।2.36.30।।,"O Devi, there is no use obstructing Rama's prosperity. O one with an auspicious countenance, save yourself from the censure of the world."
श्रुत्वा तु सिद्धार्थवचो राजा श्रान्ततरस्वनः। शोकोपहतया वाचा कैकेयीमिदमब्रवीत्।।2.36.31।।," Having heard Siddhartha, the king, stricken with grief, said to Kaikeyi in a gradually feeble voice."
एतद्वचो नेच्छसि पापवृत्ते हितं न जानासि ममात्मनो वा। आस्थाय मार्गं कृपणं कुचेष्टा चेष्टा हि ते साधुपथादपेता।।2.36.32।।," O Kaikeyi of vicious behaviour, you do not aceept even the words of Siddhartha. You woman of wicked acts, having adopted vile ways, and abjured the right path cannot know what is good either for you or for me."
अनुव्रजिष्याम्यहमद्य रामं राज्यं परित्यज्य सुखं धनं च।सहैव राज्ञा भरतेन च त्वं यथासुखं भुङ्क्ष्व चिराय राज्यम्।।2.36.33।।," Abandoning this kingdom, these comforts and this wealth, I shall follow Rama. Enjoy the kingdom for a long time happily along with king Bharata.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अयोध्याकाण्डे षट्त्रिंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends  the thirtysixth sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki."
[Rama puts on bark--Vasistha blames Kaikeyi--says Sita was not ordained to wear bark.]महामात्रवचः श्रुत्वा रामो दशरथं तदा।अभ्यभाषत वाक्यं तु विनयज्ञो विनीतवत्।।2.37.1।।," On hearing the minister, Rama who knew how to be polite spoke these words  to Dasaratha humbly:"
त्यक्तभोगस्य मे राजन् वने वन्येन जीवतः।किं कार्यमनुयात्रेण त्यक्तसङ्गस्य सर्वतः।।2.37.2।।,O king giving up pleasures and attachments altogether I am going to live on whatever is available in the forest. What is the use of followers? 
यो हि दत्त्वा द्विपश्रेष्ठं कक्ष्यायां कुरुते मनः।रज्जुस्नेहेन किं तस्य त्यजतः कुञ्जरोत्तमम्।।2.37.3।।,"Having given away the best of elephants, will any one be interested in the rope tied to its girth? Why should one have any attachment for the rope after he has given up the elephant?"
तथा मम सतां श्रेष्ठ किं ध्वजिन्या जगत्पते।सर्वाण्येवानुजानामि चीराण्येवाऽनयन्तु मे।।2.37.4।।," O best among the virtuous O lord of the world, I do not have any use for this army. I am giving away everything (to Bharata). Bring the bark only."
खनित्रपिटके चोभे समानयत गच्छतः।चतुर्दश वने वासं वर्षाणि वसतो मम।।2.37.5।।, I am going to the forest to live there for fourteen years. Bring me two things: a basket and a crowbar.
अथ चीराणि कैकेयी स्वयमाहृत्य राघवम्।उवाच परिधत्स्वेति जनौघे निरपत्रपा।।2.37.6।।,"Thereupon in the assembly of people, without any sense of shame Kaikeyi herself brought the bark robes and said to the son of the Raghus (Rama), Wear it."
स चीरे पुरुषव्याघ्रः कैकेय्या प्रतिगृह्य ते।सूक्ष्मवस्त्रमवक्षिप्य मुनिवस्त्राण्यवस्त ह।।2.37.7।।, The tiger among men (Rama) received the bark robes from Kaikeyi and putting off the fine apparel wore the robes of an ascetic.
लक्ष्मणश्चापि तत्रैव विहाय वसने शुभे।तापसाच्छादने चैव जग्राह पितुरग्रतः।।2.37.8।।,Lakshmana also  removed his auspicious raiment in front (presence) of his father and accepted (put on) the robes of an ascetic.
अथाऽत्मपरिधानार्थं सीता कौशेयवासिनी।समीक्ष्य चीरं सन्त्रस्ता पृषती वागुरामिव।।2.37.9।।,Then Sita in silk clothes glanced at the bark robes meant for her to wear and was frightened like a doe seeing a (fowler's) snare.
सा व्यपत्रपमाणेव प्रगृह्य च सुदुर्मनाः।कैकेयी कुशचीरे ते जानकी शुभलक्षणा।।2.37.10।।अश्रुसम्पूर्ण नेत्रा च धर्मज्ञा धर्मदर्शिनी।गन्धर्वराजप्रतिमं भर्तारमिदमब्रवीत्।।2.37.11।।," Sita of auspicious nature who knew her duties and understood righteousness, took the garments made of kusa grass from Kaikeyi. With a sense of abashment her eyes suffused with tears, she said to her husband who was the very image of  the king of gandharvas."
कथं नु चीरं बध्नन्ति मुनयो वनवासिनः।इति ह्यकुशला सीता सा मुमोह मुहुर्मुहुः।।2.37.12।।,"Sita, unacquainted with wearing bark robes, asked Rama, perplexed 'How do the sages who live in the forest wear bark garment?'."
कृत्वा कण्ठे च सा चीरमेकमादाय पाणिना।तस्थौ ह्यकुशला तत्र व्रीडिता जनकात्मजा।।2.37.13।।,"The daughter of Janaka, placed one end of the garment round her neck and held the other in her hand, and stood ashamed as she did not know what to do next."
तस्यास्तत्क्षिप्रमागम्य रामो धर्मभृतां वरः।चीरं बबन्ध सीतायाः कौशेयस्योपरि स्वयम्।।2.37.14।।," Rama, foremost among protectors of righteousness, came forward quickly and fastened the bark himself over her silk garment."
रामं प्रेक्ष्य तु सीताया बध्नन्तं चीरमुत्तमम्।अन्तःपुरगता नार्यो मुमुचुर्वारि नेत्रजम्।।2.37.15।।," Beholding Rama fastening the bark garment on Sita, the women of the inner apartment shed tears from their eyes."
ऊचुश्च परमायस्ता रामं ज्वलिततेजसम्।वत्स नैवं नियुक्तेयं वनवासे मनस्विनी।।2.37.16।।,"Profoundly distressed, they said to Rama glowing with burning lustre O dear, no one has ordered this highminded Sita to dwell in the forest."

कुरु नो याचनां पुत्र सीता तिष्ठतु भामिनी।धर्मनित्यस्स्वयं स्थातुं न हीदानीं त्वमिच्छसि।।2.37.19।।," Do accede to our prayer. Let lovely Sita stay with us as you, O son faithful to your duty, will not like to remain here."
तासामेवंविधा वाच शृण्वन् दशरथात्मजः।बबन्धैव तदा चीरं सीतया तुल्यशीलया।।2.37.20।।,"While Rama was listening to such words uttered by them, he got the bark robes fastened round Sita who was of similar nature."
चीरे गृहीते तु तया समीक्ष्य नृपतेर्गुरुः।निवार्य सीतां कैकेयीं वसिष्ठो वाक्यमब्रवीत्।।2.37.21।।," When Sita wore the bark garments, Vasistha, the king's preceptor who was watching this restrained her (Sita) and said to Kaikeyi:"
अतिप्रवृत्ते दुर्मेधे कैकेयि कुलपांसनि।वञ्चयित्वा च राजानं न प्रमाणेऽवतिष्ठसे।।2.37.22।।,.You are exceeding all limits of decency O Kaikeyi your motive is evil. You are a disgrace to the race You have deceived the king and your behaviour does not conform to the standards (of righteousness).

अथ यास्यति वैदेही वनं रामेण सङ्गता।वयमप्यनुयास्यामः पुरं चेदं गमिष्यति।।2.37.25।।,"Otherwise, if Sita goes with Rama to the forest, all of us along with the entire city will follow. "
अन्तपालाश्च यास्यन्ति सदारो यत्र राघवः।सहोपजीव्यं राष्ट्रं च पुरं च सपरिच्छदम्।।2.37.26।।," The guardians of the harem, its patron king Dasaratha with his retinue and, the people of this city will go wherever Rama lives with his wife. "
भरतश्च सशत्रुघ्नश्चीरवासा वनेचरः।वने वसन्तं काकुत्स्थ मनुवत्स्यति पूर्वजम्।।2.37.27।।," Wandering in the forest and wearing bark, Satrughna and Bharata will live in the company of their elder brother (Rama) in the jungle."

न ह्यदत्तां महीं पित्रा भरतः शास्तुमर्हति।त्वयि वा पुत्रवद्वस्तुं यदि जातो महीपतेः।।2.37.30।।,"If Bharata is truly born to the king, he will not rule the kingdom which has not been bestowed on him (wholeheartedly) by his father. Nor will he live like a son to you."

The peaks of those palaces were bright like towering white clouds and echoed with cries of  parrots. They were cool and fragrant with perfumes. The marvellous palaces made of golden walls are comparable to mount Meru. He used to wake up to the sounds of songs and musical instruments, the tinkling of finest ornaments and the splendid sounds of the drums. Many bards, genealogists and panegyrists singing befitting ballads and extolling his virtues at appropriate time used to salute him in reverence (Bharata lamented). "

Being a mighty protector, do not chastise us who are your servants. This is a simile.
